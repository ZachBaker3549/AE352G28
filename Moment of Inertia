# Constants for mass and dimensions 
m_m = 0.1  # Mass of a motor (kg)
m_r = 0.025  # Mass of a rod (kg)
l = 0.35/2  # Length of one arm (meters)

# Calculate moments of inertia
Jx = 2 * l**2 * (m_m + m_r / 3)  # Moment of inertia about the x-axis (kg*m^2)
Jy = Jx  # Moment of inertia about the y-axis (symmetric)
Jz = 2 * Jx  # Moment of inertia about the z-axis

# Print the calculated moments of inertia
print("Moment of inertia about x-axis (Jx):", Jx, "kg*m^2")
print("Moment of inertia about y-axis (Jy):", Jy, "kg*m^2")
print("Moment of inertia about z-axis (Jz):", Jz, "kg*m^2")
